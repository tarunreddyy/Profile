## Summary of the topic in layman’s terms:

In today's bustling cities, skyscrapers paint the skyline, vehicles thrum on the roads below, and people, engrossed in their daily routines, navigate the labyrinth of urban life. Now, imagine a bird's-eye view of this intricate tapestry. From such a height, the city appears like an elaborate maze, with its winding roads, towering buildings, and bustling hubs of activity.

But what if, instead of birds, we have drones buzzing above, trying to find their way amidst this urban jungle? These aren't your typical drones, taking casual flights. They have missions – be it delivering a package, capturing aerial footage of an event, or conducting a rapid survey. These drones require a sophisticated "brain" or system to help them navigate efficiently, ensuring they don't collide with buildings, conserve their battery, and reach their destinations swiftly.

This is where the Flight Cost RRT* (FC-RRT*) comes into play.

Imagine you're playing a video game where you have to move a character through a maze. You'd be constantly calculating and recalculating the best routes, trying to avoid obstacles and dead-ends. FC-RRT* does something very similar, but for drones in real-life urban environments. Think of it as a super-smart GPS system, designed exclusively for these flying machines. But it's not just any GPS; it's like having a seasoned cab driver who knows every alley, shortcut, and street of a city and continually updates the route based on traffic, road closures, or other unforeseen challenges.

The "Rapidly-exploring Random Trees" or RRT aspect of the algorithm is akin to the drone casting a wide net of possible paths, exploring all potential routes it can take. It's like plotting various routes on a map. But the "Star" in RRT* signifies an added layer of intelligence. The drone doesn't just find a way; it keeps refining and optimizing it. So, if a quicker or safer path becomes apparent, the drone adjusts its course.

The "Flight Cost" component takes this a step further. It's not just about finding the quickest route, but also the most energy-efficient one. Much like how we, when driving, might opt for a slightly longer route if it means smoother roads and less fuel consumption, drones equipped with FC-RRT* consider the energy or battery usage for each potential path. This ensures they don't just reach their destination quickly, but also with enough battery reserve, making their missions more successful and reliable.

To put it in even simpler terms, let's consider a relatable analogy. Imagine you're in a vast library, looking for a specific book. You have a vague idea of where it might be, so you start exploring. As you walk through the aisles, you begin to piece together a clearer path, avoiding sections you know don't contain your book. Along the way, you keep refining your search strategy, ensuring you're not wasting time or energy. The FC-RRT* algorithm is like your search strategy, guiding the drone, ensuring it doesn't waste its battery, and gets to its destination efficiently.

In essence, the FC-RRT* algorithm is the behind-the-scenes hero for drones, ensuring they navigate the intricate dance of urban environments seamlessly. It's the bridge between the digital intelligence of machines and the practical demands of the real world, ensuring our skies are safe, and drones are efficient. This approach, recently explored in-depth by Guo et al. [1], showcases the potential of advanced path-planning algorithms in urban drone navigation.

## Formal definition using appropriate notation

The FC-RRT* algorithm is fundamentally rooted in the principles of the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT*), enhanced to consider the flight costs or energy consumption when determining paths for drones. Here's a detailed breakdown of its formal definition and mechanics:

### 1. **Defining the Workspace**:

Let's start by defining our workspace. This is the environment or area where our drone operates.

- **$$ S $$**: Represents the complete workspace, including both free and obstructed spaces.
- **$$ S_{free} $$**: Denotes the subset of **S** that's free from obstacles, essentially the navigable space.


### 2. **Tree Growth and Sampling**:

The core principle of RRT* is to grow a tree that represents possible paths.

- **$$ x_{init} $$**: The starting point or the initial position of the drone.
- **$$ x_{rand} $$**: A randomly sampled point within **$$ S_{free} $$**. This serves as a potential new node for our tree.

### 3. **Connecting the Nodes**:

The tree grows by connecting these nodes, taking into consideration the shortest and most efficient routes.

- **$$ x_{nearest} $$**: For a given **$$ x_{rand} $$**, this represents the nearest node already in our tree.
- **$$ x_{new} $$**: A new node created by extending the tree from **$$ x_{nearest} $$** towards **$$ x_{rand} $$**.

Using these notations, the basic process of tree expansion in RRT* can be represented as:


**$$ x_{new} = \text{extend}(x_{nearest}, x_{rand}) $$**


Where the function "extend" represents the operation of growing the tree towards a new point.

### 4. **Path Optimization**:

The "Star" in RRT* signifies continuous refinement. Once **$$ x_{new} $$** is added:

- We inspect all nodes in a vicinity of **$$ x_{new} $$** to see if connecting through **$$ x_{new} $$** offers a shorter path.
- If a shorter path is identified, the tree is reconnected to utilize **$$ x_{new} $$** as a waypoint.

This can be mathematically represented by:


**$$ \text{if } C(x_{near}, x_{goal}) > C(x_{new}, x_{goal}) + C(x_{near}, x_{new}) $$**


Where **C** is the cost function, $$ x_{near} $$ is a neighboring node, and **$$ x_{goal} $$** is our destination. If the above condition is true, the path from **$$ x_{near} $$** to **$$ x_{goal} $$** via **$$ x_{new} $$** is shorter, and the tree is reconnected accordingly.

### 5. **Incorporating Flight Cost**:

The fundamental enhancement in FC-RRT* is the introduction of a flight cost component. Instead of just distance, the cost function **$$ C $$** also considers energy or battery consumption. This ensures the paths aren't just short, but also energy efficient.

**$$ C(x_1, x_2) = \alpha \times \text{distance}(x_1, x_2) + \beta \times \text{energy_cost}(x_1, x_2) $$**

Here, **$$ \alpha $$** and **$$ \beta $$** are weights, allowing us to balance between raw distance and energy consumption. The function "distance" calculates the spatial distance between two points, while "energy_cost" evaluates the energy consumption between the two points.

The intricacies of the FC-RRT* algorithm, as discussed by Guo et al. [1], highlight its robustness in handling complex 3D environments.

## Overview of the Key Results

Navigating the intricate web of urban environments, especially with towering skyscrapers and unpredictable obstacles, is no small feat. The FC-RRT* algorithm, tailored for such complex terrains, has showcased several remarkable results that make it a prime choice for drone navigation:

### 1. **Achieving Asymptotic Optimality**:

One of the crowning achievements of the RRT* family of algorithms, including FC-RRT*, is the guarantee of asymptotic optimality. In simpler terms, as the algorithm is allowed more time and generates more samples, the path it discovers approaches the best possible path in terms of efficiency and safety.

Mathematically, given enough samples **n**, the cost of the path **C(n)** will converge to the optimal cost **$$ C^{*} $$**:


$$ \lim_{{n \to \infty}} C(n) = C^* $$

This result ensures that the longer the FC-RRT* runs, the closer the drone's path gets to the most efficient route, both in terms of distance and energy consumption.

### 2. **Efficiency Amidst Urban Complexity**:

Urban environments are rife with challenges: high-rises casting shadows, antennae posing threats to navigation, and dynamic obstacles like other drones or birds. Yet, the FC-RRT* algorithm consistently showcases its ability to carve out efficient paths amidst such complexities. This isn't just about avoiding collisions but ensuring the drone doesn't get trapped in areas that drain its battery or consume excessive time.

### 3. **Dynamic Adaptability**:

A static path might be optimal at the start of a drone's journey, but urban environments are anything but static. New obstacles, like construction cranes, or dynamic elements, such as moving vehicles or sudden gatherings of people, can change the landscape. FC-RRT*'s continuous refinement ensures that the drone can adapt its path in real-time, responding to changing conditions.

### 4. **Energy and Flight Cost Awareness**:

Beyond just finding a clear path, FC-RRT* shines in its ability to factor in energy costs. For commercial drones, especially those on delivery or extended survey missions, battery life is precious. By integrating energy consumption into its decision-making process, the algorithm ensures drones can maximize their operational time, leading to more successful missions. 

This is particularly crucial in urban settings where landing spots might be limited, and the drone needs to ensure it has enough battery reserve to return to a safe location.

### 5. **Safety and Reliability**:

While efficiency and speed are crucial, safety remains paramount. FC-RRT* has demonstrated a high degree of reliability in ensuring drones avoid collisions, even in densely populated urban terrains. This not only protects the drone but also ensures the safety of the urban populace and infrastructure.


Certainly! The realm of robotics hinges on advanced decision-making, and path-planning algorithms like FC-RRT* play a central role in this. Let's delve deeper into how the FC-RRT* algorithm influences and enhances decision-making in robotics, especially in urban settings.

### 3. **Energy-Efficient Decisions**:

For many robots, especially drones, energy is a finite resource. Every decision they make, from the speed they fly at to the route they take, impacts their energy consumption. The FC-RRT* algorithm allows robots to factor in energy or flight costs into their decision-making process. This means drones can decide not just based on the shortest route but also the most energy-efficient one.

### 4. **Safety-Centric Decisions**:

In crowded urban areas, safety becomes paramount. Robots need to ensure they don't pose a threat to humans, other robots, or infrastructure. FC-RRT* provides a framework for robots to prioritize safety in their decision-making. By continually refining paths and avoiding obstacles, the algorithm ensures robots take the safest route possible.

### 5. **Interfacing with Sensor Data**:

Modern robots are equipped with a plethora of sensors, from cameras to LiDAR. These sensors continually feed data about the robot's environment. FC-RRT* can interface with this data, allowing robots to make informed decisions based on their current surroundings. For instance, if a drone's camera detects a new obstacle, the algorithm can immediately factor this into its path planning.

### 6. **Scalable Decisions for Complex Environments**:

As urban environments become more complex, the decision-making process for robots becomes more challenging. FC-RRT*, with its ability to sample and explore large spaces, offers a scalable solution.
